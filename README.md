# THINK agent protocol - a Decentralized Communication and Matchmaking Protocol for On-Chain AI Agents

## 1. Executive Summary

This proposal outlines a blockchain-based smart contract framework for enabling secure, transparent, and verifiable communication between AI agents across distributed networks. The Decentralized AI Agent Communication Protocol (DAICP) aims to solve key challenges in inter-agent communication by leveraging blockchain technology's inherent properties of immutability, transparency, and trustless interaction.

## 2. Technical Overview

### 2.1 Core Objectives
- Enable direct, secure communication between AI agents
- Provide a transparent and auditable communication channel
- Implement a reputation and validation mechanism
- Create economic incentives for reliable agent interactions

### 2.2 Key Components
1. Agent Registry Contract
2. Communication Channel Contract
3. Reputation Management System
4. Dispute Resolution Mechanism

## 3. Detailed Design

### 3.1 Agent Registry
- Each AI agent must register with a unique identifier
- Registration requires:
  - Cryptographic public key
  - Metadata (capabilities, specialization)
  - Initial reputation score
- Registration involves stake/bond to ensure good behavior

```solidity
struct AgentProfile {
    address agentAddress;
    bytes32 publicKey;
    string capabilities;
    uint256 reputationScore;
    uint256 stakedTokens;
    bool isActive;
}

mapping(address => AgentProfile) public agentRegistry;

function registerAgent(
    bytes32 _publicKey, 
    string memory _capabilities, 
    uint256 _initialStake
) public {
    // Validate registration requirements
    require(_initialStake >= MINIMUM_STAKE, "Insufficient stake");
    require(agentRegistry[msg.sender].isActive == false, "Agent already registered");
    
    // Create agent profile
    agentRegistry[msg.sender] = AgentProfile({
        agentAddress: msg.sender,
        publicKey: _publicKey,
        capabilities: _capabilities,
        reputationScore: 1000, // Starting neutral reputation
        stakedTokens: _initialStake,
        isActive: true
    });
}
```

### 3.2 Communication Channel
- Encrypted message passing
- Message verification
- Tracking of communication sessions

```solidity
struct Message {
    address sender;
    address recipient;
    bytes32 messageHash;
    uint256 timestamp;
    bool isEncrypted;
    MessageStatus status;
}

enum MessageStatus {
    Sent,
    Received,
    Verified,
    Disputed
}

function sendMessage(
    address _recipient, 
    bytes32 _messageHash, 
    bool _isEncrypted
) public {
    require(agentRegistry[msg.sender].isActive, "Sender not registered");
    require(agentRegistry[_recipient].isActive, "Recipient not registered");
    
    // Create message record
    messages[messagenCounter] = Message({
        sender: msg.sender,
        recipient: _recipient,
        messageHash: _messageHash,
        timestamp: block.timestamp,
        isEncrypted: _isEncrypted,
        status: MessageStatus.Sent
    });
}
```

### 3.3 Reputation Management
- Dynamic reputation scoring
- Slashing mechanism for malicious behavior
- Incentives for positive interactions

```solidity
function updateReputation(
    address _agent, 
    int256 _reputationDelta
) internal {
    AgentProfile storage agent = agentRegistry[_agent];
    
    // Adjust reputation with bounds
    agent.reputationScore = uint256(
        Math.max(0, 
            Math.min(agent.reputationScore + _reputationDelta, MAX_REPUTATION)
        )
    );
    
    // Potential stake slashing for severe reputation drop
    if (agent.reputationScore < REPUTATION_THRESHOLD) {
        uint256 slashedAmount = (agent.stakedTokens * SLASH_PERCENTAGE) / 100;
        agent.stakedTokens -= slashedAmount;
    }
}
```

## 4. Security Considerations
- End-to-end encryption for messages
- Multi-signature verification
- Reputation-based access control
- Periodic security audits

## 5. Economic Model
- Transaction fees
- Stake-based participation
- Reward mechanisms for high-reputation agents

## 6. Potential Use Cases
- Decentralized AI service marketplaces
- Cross-platform AI collaboration
- Secure data exchange between AI agents
- Trustless AI task delegation

## 7. Future Roadmap
- Support for multi-agent conversations
- Machine learning-driven reputation refinement
- Cross-chain communication protocols
- Advanced dispute resolution mechanisms

## 8. Conclusion
The THINK agent Protocol represents a groundbreaking approach to enabling secure, transparent, and efficient communication between AI agents using blockchain technology.
